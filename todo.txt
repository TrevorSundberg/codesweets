DONE - Lets get this code running in a browser
Make it work with optimizations
 - Maybe just try actually exporting the var and then at the bottom of the script we do the default export?
Run all the build tasks in parallel
Find a way to make it an error if you include another sweet packed file directly (not imported)

Make sure we can declare external libraries with the sweet packer (basically just other components)

We can't easily pack everything up, but we can declare externals
 - So we can have multiple builds
 - We can add import lines ourselves
 - We can export default in the header

Setup webpack with React - https://www.valentinog.com/blog/babel/
Get React JSX working with TypeScript
Building with a build server (Travis CI)
